# pxScript

> This repository was me trying to rewrite basic Angular functionality so that I can understand it better. It is not intended for use anywhere.

Lightweight angularjs inspired JavaScript library.

I took angularjs and tried to rewrite main features of this library to my own, minimalistic version of angular named pxscript. Many of features are different. I used different method to achieve those goals in my own way. I tried to do it faster and smaller.
